# YouTube Downloader
This script is a simple command-line program for downloading YouTube videos and audios using the yt_dlp library. The program prompts the user to select whether they want to download a video or an audio file, and then asks for the URL of the YouTube video they want to download, the location to save the downloaded file, and whether the URL is for a playlist or not.
